✅ What I did:
-> Built a basic ML model using Naive Bayes.
-> Created my own email dataset (sender, subject, body, label).
-> Tried Logistic, SVM, and Random Forest → got 93% accuracy with RF.
-> Improved dataset with noise samples (thanks to ChatGPT).
-> Manually labeled 90+ emails from my inbox.
-> Attempted Gmail API integration for automating data fetch.

What I learned:
-> Basics of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.
-> How Random Forest works and how to visualize it.
-> Difference between ML models and rule-based logic.
-> Realized the impact of giving raw vs. summarized data to ML models.
-> A model can show 100% accuracy but still fail in real-world testing.

❓ What I struggled with:
-> Initial dataset structure—model couldn’t find patterns.
-> Overfitting issue due to simplified mail content.
-> Balancing dataset (especially the “Others” label).
-> Gmail API integration failed in Colab due to browser limitations.

📌 Next Steps:
-> Fix Gmail API issue (try local setup or different auth flow).
-> Feed actual/raw mail content into the model.
-> Balance dataset better and clean noisy labels.
-> Explore text embeddings to improve model performance.
-> Modularize code for better reusability.
