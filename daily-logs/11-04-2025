‚úÖ What I did:

feat: integrated Gmail API and authenticated using token credentials

feat: extracted 250 emails into CSV with sender, subject, snippet, and manual labels

feat: started iteration 2 of mail automation agent

feat: added preprocessing functions to combine features into a single input vector

feat: visualized dataset and target label distribution

feat: cleaned and preprocessed data for model training

feat: trained logistic regression model with beginner-friendly setup and good accuracy

üí° What I learned:

docs: understood Gmail API token generation process

docs: improved understanding of Python function logic

docs: visualized target variable to explore label distribution

docs: learned full preprocessing pipeline for text classification

docs: applied label encoding and TF-IDF vectorization

docs: compared classification models using accuracy and confusion matrix

‚ùì What I struggled with:

chore: unsure about model selection for scaling

chore: faced logic confusion in custom preprocessing functions

fix: resolved tf-idf and label encoding issues with shape mismatch

chore: understood importance of matching input shapes for train/test sets

üìå Next Steps:

Imporve models efficieny and performance in real data
